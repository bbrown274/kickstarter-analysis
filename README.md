# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

In the US, theater projects are the most common Kickstarter campaigns and are successful more often than not. The chart below shows US campaigns by category and outcome.

The timing of the campaign launch appears to play a role in whether or not a campaign is successful. As seen in the chart below, May and June have the highest number of successful campaigns.

The funding goal can also determine how likely a campaign is to be successful. Failed campaigns consistently have higher goals than successful campaigns. Looking at US plays specifically, the average successful goal is around $5,000 while the average failed goal is twice as much. The median successful goal is $3,000 and the median failed goal is $5,000. 

Based on this data, I would recommend that Louise launch her campaign in May and have a funding goal of around $3,000 for her play.
